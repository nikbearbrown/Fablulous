# Fablulous: Twisted Tales üåü‚ú®

*"Once upon a time... but what if it didn't happen that way at all?"*

**A comedic homage to Rocky & Bullwinkle's "Fractured Fairy Tales" exploring counterfactual "what if" scenarios that challenge everything we think we know about classic stories.**

## ‚ú® The Counterfactual Concept

Just like the beloved "Fractured Fairy Tales" asked "what if this familiar story went completely differently," **Fablulous: Twisted Tales** explores alternate realities through the lens of identity, culture, time, and self-expression. What if Cinderella was a Renaissance inventor? What if Little Red Riding Hood was the wolf? What if Sleeping Beauty lived in 1920s Harlem?

### üîÑ Types of Counterfactuals We Explore
- **Cultural Shifts**: What if these tales happened in different cultures/time periods?
- **Gender Flips**: What if traditional roles were completely reversed?
- **Identity Inversions**: What if the "villain" was actually the hero?
- **Historical Relocations**: What if fairy tales happened during the Industrial Revolution? The Space Race? The Renaissance?
- **Modern Transplants**: What if these characters lived in today's world with today's challenges?

### üì∫ Format & Style
- **Narrator-Driven**: Witty, punny voiceover questioning assumptions
- **Visual Contradictions**: Showing familiar scenes with unexpected twists
- **Historical Mashups**: Mixing time periods, cultures, and contexts
- **Identity Exploration**: Characters expressing themselves through style, culture, and choices
